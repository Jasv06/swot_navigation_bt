# Robot Configuration Parameters

# velocity limits 
  max_trans_vel: 0.18 #
  min_trans_vel: 0.08 #
  # max_vel_x: 0.18 #The maximum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec 
  # min_vel_x: 0.08 #The minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec. It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction.

  max_vel_theta:  0.5 # The maximum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec 
  min_vel_theta: -0.5 # The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec
  min_in_place_vel_theta: 0.5 #The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base while performing in-place rotations in radians/sec

# acceleration limits
  acc_lim_x: 0.6 #1.0 #The x acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
  acc_lim_y: 0.3 #The y acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
  acc_lim_theta: 0.6 #The rotational acceleration limit of the robot in radians/sec^2

# Goal Tolerance Parameters
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.10 # The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance when achieving a goal
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.05 # The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal 

# Differential-drive robot configuration
  holonomic_robot: true #Determines whether velocity commands are generated for a holonomic or non-holonomic robot. For holonomic robots, strafing velocity commands may be issued to the base. For non-holonomic robots, no strafing velocity commands will be issued. 

# Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 0.8 #The amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories in seconds
  vx_samples: 18 # The number of samples to use when exploring the x velocity space 
  vtheta_samples: 20 #The number of samples to use when exploring the theta velocity space
  sim_granularity: 0.05 #The step size, in meters, to take between points on a given trajectory
